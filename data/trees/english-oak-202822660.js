			"content" : "The English oak is a large deciduous tree, native to most of Europe. It is a long-lived tree, with a large wide-spreading crown of rugged branches. The leaves are lobed and are a glossy dark green colour. The acorns are borne in a cup-like structure known as a cupule. The English oak is a symbol of strength and endurance, and is the national tree of England."
