			"content" : "The Sweet Chestnut is a large deciduous tree that can grow up to 35m tall. It has a broad crown and a straight trunk. The bark is grey and smooth when young, becoming deeply fissured with age. The leaves are long and lance-shaped with toothed edges. The flowers are yellowish-white and appear in long catkins in late spring. The fruit is a spiky husk containing one or two shiny brown nuts. Sweet Chestnuts are native to southern Europe and western Asia, but have been widely planted in the UK. They are often found in parks, gardens and woodlands. The nuts are edible and can be roasted and eaten."
