			"content" : "The Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto) is a species of oak native to southeastern Europe, in the Balkans and Italy. It is a deciduous tree growing to 25–35 m tall, with a trunk up to 1.5 m diameter. The leaves are 7–14 cm long and 4–6 cm broad, lobed, dark green above, paler beneath; the lobes are more regular than those of Turkey oak. The acorns are 2–3 cm long, grouped 2-5 together on a peduncle 2–5 cm long; the acorns are very bitter, but are eaten by jays and pigeons. The tree is grown as an ornamental tree in parks and large gardens."
