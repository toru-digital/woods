The bark is smooth and grey, and the leaves are large, with five lobes and toothed edges. The flowers are yellow-green and appear in spring, followed by winged seeds in autumn. The sycamore maple is native to central Europe and is commonly planted as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. It is also used for timber and maple syrup production."
