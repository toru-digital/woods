			"content" : "The wild cherry is a deciduous tree that is native to Europe, western Asia, and parts of North Africa. It is a medium-sized tree that can reach heights of up to 30m. The bark is smooth and reddish-brown, and the leaves are oval and toothed. The wild cherry produces small white flowers in spring, followed by red or black cherries in summer. The cherries are edible and are popular with birds. The wood of the wild cherry is prized for its attractive colour and grain, and is used in furniture-making and cabinet-making."
