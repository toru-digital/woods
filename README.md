## Usage

```bash
nvm use 18;
npm i;
npm run dev;
```

## Folders

### pages

Nuxt uses file routing for pages, e.g. / = pages/index.vue and /trees = pages/trees.vue

### layouts

Page routing can include layouts, by default the layouts/defualt.vue is used, but you can use others by defining page meta fields.

```sh
definePageMeta({
	layout: "minimal",
});
```

### components

Folder for app components

### interfaces

Interfaces used for types within the app

### plugins

Define app plugins here, for now we just register the vuex store.

### store

Contains the store config

## Local Testing

ngrok can be used to expose your local app over a public url, once you have nuxt running locally you can run the following

```sh
ngrok http http://localhost:3000
```

this will give you a public endpoint which you can open on your phone.
the address will look something like https://xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app

You'll need the latest version of NGROK, and then you need to set your token...
